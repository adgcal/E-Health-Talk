# Systems Dynamics Modelling (SDM)  and Agent based Models (ABM)

- <https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-019-4627-7>


# SDM ADM details
- SDM simulates the movement of entities in a system (aggregate behaviour)
    - can be interpreted as mimicking the flow of water in and out of a bath tub. 
    - how much ‘water’ (some resource) can leave or enter a ‘bath tub’ (a stock) as a function of  environmental or operational) constrains
- ABM is a ground-up representation of a system, simulating the changing states of individual ‘agents’ in a system.

#  Why use SDM and ABM to model health systems?

- ABM is well-suited to explore systems with dynamic patient or health worker activity, a limitation of other differential equation or event-based simulation tools 
- SDM is best implemented where the aim of the simulation is to examine aggregate flows, trends and sub-system behaviour as opposed to intricate individual flows of activity

# The least e-Health can do - A quote from Nick Dawson

"Aravind Eye Hospital in India does more eye surgeries than any other place in the world. It treats nearly 2 million patients a year, for remarkably less than most hospitals in the United States, and it treats nearly two-thirds of those patients for free. If my Yelp app on my iPhone tells me FedEx can get raw fish to Aspen, we can surely get the blind to India."-ND

# SIR Model 
A simple mathematical description of the spread of a disease in a population is the so-called *SIR model*. (Kermack and McKendrick ,**Proc. R. Soc. A, 115, 772 1927**)

# The story behind the SIR model
A simple mathematical description of the spread of a disease in a population is the so-called *SIR model*, ime t.
- S(t) are those susceptible but not yet infected with the disease;
- I(t) is the number of infectious individuals;
- R(t) are those individuals who have recovered from the disease and now have immunity to it.


# Equations
\begin{align}
  \frac{dS}{dt}= −\beta \cdot S\cdot I /N  \\
 \frac{dI}{dt}=\beta \cdot S\cdot I /N  −\gamma I \\
  \frac{dR}{dt}= \gamma I
 \end{align}

# Initialization 
```{python}
# Total population, N.
N = 1000
# Initial number of infected and recovered individuals, I0 and R0.
I0, R0 = 1, 0
# Everyone else, S0, is susceptible to infection initially.
S0 = N - I0 - R0
# Contact rate, beta, and mean recovery rate, gamma, (in 1/days).
beta, gamma = 0.8, 3./10 
t = np.linspace(0, 40, 160)
```

# The model in python 
```{python}
def deriv(y, t, N, beta, gamma):
    S, I, R = y
    dSdt = -beta * S * I / N
    dIdt = beta * S * I / N - gamma * I
    dRdt = gamma * I
    return dSdt, dIdt, dRdt
```


# Simulating the SIR model 
```{python}
y0 = S0, I0, R0
# Integrate the SIR equations over the time grid, t.
ret = odeint(deriv, y0, t, args=(N, beta, gamma))
S, I, R = ret.T
```

plt.legend(bbox_to_anchor=(0.65, 0.75),\
  loc='upper left', borderaxespad=0.)
```


# Sympy 


The analytical expression for Jacobian of the SIR model assumes 

$$\left[\begin{matrix}- \frac{I \beta}{N} & - \frac{S \beta}{N}\\\frac{I \beta}{N} & \gamma + \frac{S \beta}{N}\end{matrix}\right]$$

# The steady stae of the SIR 

\tiny
s_S = sympy.Eq(dSdt, 0)
s_I = sympy.Eq(dIdt, 0)
s_R = sympy.Eq(dRdt, 0)

s_S_sol = sympy.solve(s_S, S)
s_I_sol = sympy.solve(s_I,I)
s_R_sol = sympy.solve(s_R,R)

print('The steady state solution for the different populations  are:')
s_S_sol,s_I_sol,s_R_sol

The steady state solution for the different populations  are:0,0. This actually implies S=S(ss),I=I(ss)




# Extended SIR Model 
It may be noted that though  SIR model model is simplistic the pattern remains similar for complicated cases (Multi-city modeling of epidemics using spatial networks: Application to 2019-nCov (COVID-19) coronavirus in India< https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.13.20035386>)

# Output of the connected model 
![](./image/many_infec.png)





# The SEIR Story 
Many diseases have a latent phase during which the individual is infected but not yet infectious. This delay between the acquisition of infection and the infectious state can be incorporated within the SIR model by adding a latent/exposed population, E, and letting infected (but not yet infectious) individuals move from S to E and from E to I. 

# SEIR without vital dynamics
In a closed population with no births or deaths, the SEIR model becomes:

\begin{align}
\frac{dS}{dt} & = -\frac{\beta SI}{N}\\
\frac{dE}{dt} & = \frac{\beta SI}{N} - \sigma E\\
\frac{dI}{dt} & = \sigma E - \gamma I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} & = \gamma I
\end{align}

where N = S + E + I + R is the total population.

# Numerical Simulation to the SEIR model

![](./image/seir.png)


# Analytical Solution to the SEIR model 
The steady state solution for the different populations  are:

$$\left ( \left [ \frac{N \left(N \mu + R \zeta\right)}{I \beta + N \nu}\right ], \quad \left [ \frac{I S \beta}{N \left(\nu + \sigma\right)}\right ], \quad \left [ \frac{E \sigma}{\gamma + \nu}\right ], \quad \left [ \frac{I \gamma}{\nu + \zeta}\right ]\right )$$
- Point to note : excepting for S , no dependence  on N.

# Implications of the SEIR

- Longer latency period will result in slower initial growth of the outbreak.
- However, since the model does not include mortality, the basic reproductive number, $R0 = \beta/\gamma$, does not change.

- After the initial fast growth, the epidemic depletes the susceptible population. 
-  Eventually the virus cannot find enough new susceptible people and dies out.
- Introducing the incubation period does not change the cumulative number of infected individuals.

# Jacobian of the SEIR 
$$\left[\begin{matrix}- \frac{I \beta}{N} - \nu & 0 & - \frac{S \beta}{N} & \zeta\\\frac{I \beta}{N} & - \nu - \sigma & \frac{S \beta}{N} & 0\\0 & \sigma & - \gamma - \nu & 0\\0 & 0 & \gamma & - \nu - \zeta\end{matrix}\right]$$

\frac{dv}{dt}=v−v^3−w+I_{ext}\\
\tau \frac{dw}{dt}=v−a−bw

# Digitization of ECG Signal  
- <sub>Researchers want to analyze the actual value of signals, i.e., the value of this ECG signal in milivolts. </sub>
- <sub>But to process information using computers, they must collect the signals via some capturing device which discretely samples, and digitizes the signals into $2^N$ levels, where N is the resolution of the device. </sub>
- <sub> Each sample captured requires N bits to store, and takes one of 2^N possible integer values. - There is also information stored which allows the user/program to map these integers back to the physical values the device managed to capture given its resolution. </sub>
- <sub>For example if they have a 12 bit oscilloscope, they have 4096 levels to capture the range and details of the signal.</sub>
- <sub>A higher N allows us to resolve finer details, but requires more storage space per sample.</sub>


# PhysioNet 
- For e-health  this is what NCBI is to *Bioinformatics*.This is supported by the **National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) and the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)** under NIH grant number 2R01GM104987-09.
- The following site provides deeper insights into the data format used in physionet

<http://archive.physionet.org/faq.shtml#physiobank-formats>

# Overview of Physionet 
- <sub> Clinical Databases: Data from critical care clinical settings </sub>
- <sub>Waveform Databases: High resolution continuous recordings of physiological signals</sub>
- <sub>Waveform databases are organized according to their signal and annotation types.</sub>
- <sub>Multi-Parameter Databases: Available signals vary, but may include ECG, continuous invasive blood pressure, respiration, oxygen saturation, and EEG, among others.</sub>


- Physionet provides the **WFDB software package** highly useful for reading, writing, and processing the above described WFDB files.
- The popular WFDB platforms are MATLAB & PYTHON

# MIT Format
- <sub>MIT Signal files **(.dat)** are binary files containing samples of digitized signals. These store the waveforms, but they cannot be interpreted properly without their corresponding header files.</sub>
- <sub> MIT Header files **(.hea)** are short text files that describe the contents of associated signal files.</sub>
- <sub> Annotation files **(.atr)** . Thr filr record.dat may be accompanied with RECORDNAME.atr.</sub>



# European Data Format (EDF)
- <sub>EDF files contain digital signals stored in their standard international format.</sub>
-  <sub>EDF files store their header information at the beginning of the file, as opposed to MIT format which has a separate header file.</sub>
-  <sub>EDF is a WFDB and PhysioBank-compatible format. </sub>
-  <sub>If a directory contains RECORDNAME.edf and RECORDNAME.edf.qrs, the .qrs file is the annotation file associated with the record.</sub>

# Data Silos 

- A data silo is a collection of information in an organization that is isolated from and not accessible by other parts of the organization. 
- Removing data silos can help you get the right information at the right time so you can make good decisions.
- And, you can save money by reducing storage costs for duplicate information.


# About healthcare today, we talk about the silos a lot
- Very rarely does infrastructure technology create the hype that blockchain currently has
- The challenges that blockchain addresses in healthcare are very disruptive

# Block Chain in Healthcare  

- Synaptic Health Alliance=Optum+Humana+MultiPlan+Quest 
- Aetna+ Ascension
- Indian telemedicine https://vhealth.io/ by Aetna

# Prophecy:Blockchain next dramatic innovation in Healthcare
\small 
- Multiple people looking at the same information
- Quality of that information should go up 
- Operational costs for the provider and payers lesser
- should go down because there's less-frequent contact being done between those two stakeholders. 
-blockchain allows us to connect those silos and … enable new capabilities (so that) access to information no longer is where we compete
